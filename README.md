## Hello from Soulaiman ðŸ‘‹
A software architect and software engineer with 15+ years professional experience. I worked for financial services, ecommerce and logistics industries. Working for mid-sized German companies as well as Berlin based start-ups (including corporate start-up from Oetker Group) have extended my skills and mindset to be more efficient and communicative. 

I joined the Elia Group in 2020 as a solution / software architect. I am responsible for translating the group technical strategy into measurable actions, setting detailed plans for products and technology roadmap and steering the development teams.
